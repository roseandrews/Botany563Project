I am going to work with several species from the Cupressaceae family: Calocedrus decurrens, Sequoia sempervirens, Hesperocyparis abramsiana, Hesperocyparis forbesii, Hesperocyparis macnabiana, Juniperus occidentalis, and Juniperus osteosperma. Available sequences of chloroplast DNA (trn V intron, trn L–trn F, trn K–mat K) will be obtained from GenBank.
